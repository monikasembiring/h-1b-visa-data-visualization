# H-1B Visa Application: Strategize for a better chance to be certified

This analysis was originally a project I (Monika Sembiring) did with my friend Bindu Rajanna in our 95885 - Data Science and Big Data class at Carnegie Mellon University. 

## Background and Motivation
Universities across the United States are prime destinations for students worldwide to pursue a master's or undergraduate degree. For international students, attending university in the US is arduous. The visa process in the United States is lengthy and cumbersome. Once students graduate, they must change their visa status, which involves obtaining an H-1B visa. Our motivation for this project stems from the fact that H-1B visas are necessary for every international student, and knowing more specific details and insights will help us. We, as students, experience some ambiguous statements or frustrating moments about H-1B visas. Hence, we want to analyze the historical data of H-1B visa applications to find insights to help us to define a strategy/focus for job search.

## Project Goals
Based on the background above, the main goal of doing this analysis is to give recommendations on how one should tailor their strategy related to the H-1B visa petition. We will answer the following questions to achieve the goal.
Since we are interested in Data Scientist and Product manager roles, we will first analyze the data with a general viewpoint and then address the following questions specific to the Data scientist and Product manager roles.

1. How different are my chances of being approved for these two roles?
2. Is there any salary figure we should consider for a higher probability of being approved?
3. How does location affect the H-1B approval rate, and are there any specific locations with a high success rate? Why do they have such a high success rate? Should one apply in a state with fewer applicants?
4. Which company do I need to choose to increase my certified rate?
5. Will we have a better chance of being approved if the employer is represented by an agent/attorney to do the petition?

## Dataset
H-1B visa petition status data from the US Department of Labor.

## Result
Based on the data we analyzed, these are some tips and insights to be more likely to be approved for an H-1B visa application:

1. Aim for a higher paying job that will allow you to apply for higher wage levels categories such as Level III and Level IV (details of average salary at different locations at each wage level for approvals given in the analysis below).
2. Aim for technical roles.
3. Data Scientists and Product Managers have similar chances of getting approved. However, there is a difference in average salary between approved Data Scientists and Product Managers.
4. Apply for a job with locations in new tech hubs such as New Jersey (NJ) and Illinois (IL) other than three other big states (CA, NY, and TX).
5. Choose cities (detail given in the analysis below) with a more prominent probability of being accepted that can be referred to when candidates need to choose among several cities the company offers.
6. Do not make any mistakes on your application.
7. Choose a company with a good history, not one with historical problems regarding H-1B visas.
8. Choose a company that uses an agent/attorney to process the H-1B visa petition.

*Notes:
The data used for this analysis is so big hence I cannot store it here in Github. Therefore, if you want to get the data to run the Notebook properly, you can download them from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13M1jWV0Kx9ZmVdWD4nsszIo3MFMscm1l?usp=sharing). You can download the Notebook and the data to open them in your local Jupyter Notebook or open it using Google Colab.*
